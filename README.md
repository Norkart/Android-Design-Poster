##About

This is a poster summarising the Android Design Principles in a handy A3 format that can be printed out and hung up on your wall for everyday reference, inspiration and propagandising.

There are images included intended to illustrate the poster, but they didn't fit on an A3 poster. They've been kept for future possible A2/A1 posters. The poster styling is very basic and not in any way done by a professional designer... If you want to help create new posters or improve existing ones, feel free to send a pull request!

If you want to edit the SVG, remember to have the [Android Roboto font](http://developer.android.com/design/downloads/index.html) installed on your system.
